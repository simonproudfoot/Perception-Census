00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.300
We'd love you to join us in an
exploration of your senses.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.220
We want thousands of you to take part

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.140
in the Perception Census.
A set of interactive tasks and questions

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.900
exploring how you experience
the world and yourself within it.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.340
Perception is the process

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.300
by which the brain interprets
the information coming in through

7
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.420
the senses, to create our unique experience
of the world. Whether it's the light

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.660
that reaches the eyes, or the pressure
waves in the air that reach the ears.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.860
Through perception,
we're able to experience a vivid world

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.500
filled with colours, shapes, objects,
sounds and more...

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.260
and we experience ourselves as occupying
a central role within this world.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.920
Understanding how perception works has
occupied scientists and philosophers

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.320
for centuries, and there's
still plenty we don't know.

14
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.700
One key question is about something
known as perceptual diversity.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.860
Just as we all differ from the outside,
we all differ on the inside too.

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.380
The Perception Census will help us
understand much more about

17
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.410
the similarities and differences
which exist between us,

18
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.930
and by taking part,
you'll help us understand more about how

19
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.900
the unique way in which we each encounter
the world, shapes our lives and who we are.

20
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.820
The Perception Census is
made up of several sections.

21
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.060
We'd love everyone to complete
the Fundamentals of Perception first,

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.900
and then you can choose which of the other
sections you'd like to do next.

23
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.900
Each section won't take long to complete,
and all you'll need is your own computer.

24
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.260
Do as many, or as few, sections as you like.

25
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.420
It's up to you, and the more you do,
the more valuable the research becomes.

26
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.850
There's no need to do
everything in one sitting.

27
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.850
You can return to the census as many times

28
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.140
as you like and will keep
track of your progress.

29
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.850
Thank you for contributing
to this research.

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.780
We want you to know that every person

31
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.100
taking part really does make a massive
difference, and we hope you'll enjoy

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.460
learning more about your particular
way of making sense of the world.

33
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.280
